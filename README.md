## Welcome! ##

### I'm Pedro, 20 years old, and I'm studying computer science at the University of São Paulo. This is a portfolio that gathers all the projects developed by me. ###
 
### I got interested in programming when I was 15 and started studying python on my own since then, I learned C and C++ during the technical course I took while in high school and also during the first semesters of my undergraduate studies, where I could also learn Java and Assembly. In addition, I had the opportunity to take minicourses on SQL, HTML and Machine Learning during the first semesters of my undergraduate studies. ###

### For a brief period, I worked as a junior developer for a company that offers healthcare services, where I was able to put my knowledge of C++, Python and Java into practice, as well as learn how to create and maintain RPAs, chatbots and APIs. ###
